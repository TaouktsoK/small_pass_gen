# small_pass_gen
small gen pass, has a small python script that creates pseudo random passwords if run in a command line
for people that are bored of thinking a combination of characters as their new password. 
I have tried running it in windows 10 command promt and in linux terminal and runs ok.


running pass_gen.py will create the password using the other two python scripts for shuffling and
choosing the characters.
